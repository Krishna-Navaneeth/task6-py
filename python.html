    <h2><u>Python</u></h2>
    <p>
        Python is a general-purpose, interpreted, high-level programming language popularly used for website development, data analytics and automation<br>
        <h4>output in Python</h4>
        To  get output printed in js environment we use command "print()"<br>
        <h4>comments in Python</h4>
        comments are represented with using """ """ for multi-line code and #for single-line codes
        <h4>Variables</h4>
        Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no command for declaring a variable.
        Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.<br>
        <h4>Data types</h4>
        Python has data types built-in by default,they are namely:<br>
        Text Type:	str<br>
        Numeric Types:	int, float, complex<br>
        Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range<br>
        Mapping Type:	dict<br>
        Set Types:	set, frozenset<br>
        Boolean Type:	bool<br>
        Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview<br>
        None Type:	NoneType<br>
        <h4>If ... Else</h4>
        Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code.<br>
        Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics and An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.<br>
        <b>Example for if statement:</b>
        a = 33<br>
        b = 200<br>
        if b > a:<br>
        print("b is greater than a")<br>
        In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a.
         As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".<br><br>
        The 'elif' keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".<br>
        <b>Example for elif statement:</b>
        a = 33<br>
        b = 33<br>
        if b > a:<br>
        print("b is greater than a")<br>
        elif a == b:<br>
        print("a and b are equal")<br>
        here a is equal to b, so the first condition is not true, but the elif condition is true, so we print to screen that "a and b are equal".<br><br>
        The 'else'  keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.<br>
        <b>Example for else statement:</b>
        a = 200<br>
        b = 33<br>
        if b > a:<br>
        print("b is greater than a")<br>
        elif a == b:<br>
        print("a and b are equal")<br>
        else:<br>
        print("a is greater than b")<br>
        <h4>For loop</h4>
        Python frequently uses the Loop to iterate over iterable objects like lists, tuples, and strings. A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence<br> 
        Syntax of for Loop:<br>
        for value in sequence: <br> 
        {loop body}   <br>
        <b>Example of for statement:</b>
        numbers = [3, 5, 23, 6, 5, 1, 2, 9, 8]  <br>
        sum_ = 0  <br>
        for num in numbers:  <br>
        sum_ = sum_ + num ** 2   <br>
        print("The sum of squares is: ", sum_)  <br>
        <h4>Strings</h4>
        Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
        'hello world' is the same as "hello world"<br>
        we can also assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes<br>
        we have string methods also in python(in every language we have string methods)<br>
        for example some namely methods are:<br>
        Slicing, Slice From the Start, Slice to End, Negative Indexing, <br>
        Upper Case, Lower Case, Remove Whitespace,Replace String, Split String<br>
        String Concatenation, String Format, Escape Character and many more<br>
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. 
        A function can return data as a result.<br>
        In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
        Example: <br>
            def my_function():<br>
            print("Hello from a function")<br>
        <br>
        <b>Arguments</b>
        Information can be passed into functions as arguments. Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. 
        You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
        <br>
        <b>Parameters or Arguments?</b>
        The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.<br>
        <b>Number of Arguments</b>
        By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments,
         you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.<br>
         <b>Arbitrary Arguments, *args</b>
         If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.
          This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments<br>
          <b>Recursion</b>
          Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.
            Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself.
             This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.<br>
             <b>Example</b>
            def tri_recursion(k):<br>
            if(k > 0):<br>
            result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)<br>
            print(result)<br>
            else:<br>
            result = 0<br>
            return result<br>
            <br>
            print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")<br>
            tri_recursion(6)<br>
